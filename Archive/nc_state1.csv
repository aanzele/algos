AEE 550  Leadership Theory  (3 credit hours)  
Leadership is ubiquitous in our society. It remains one of the world's favorite buzz words. However, just because it's everywhere, doesn't mean everything labeled so, is leadership. This graduate course in leadership theory will require you to critically examine your ideas of leadership, and reflect on your own (and society's) notions of ""what is leadership"". In this class we will separate the skills you gain from going out and doing leadership (the do) and the theories that provide the foundations for leadership (the think). Many successful leaders learn their skills via practice; that is important. AEE 550, however, is a leadership education course where we study leadership theory. We will take those theories, long associated with the academic study of leadership, and deconstruct them using critical theory as our lens. Then, using the text as guide, reconstruct them in new ways to meet today's pressing challenges.

We discuss the current methods and techniques for simulations using deterministic, stochastic and rule-based models as well as agent-based simulation of complex systems. Hands-on component of the course will cover implementation of simulations in GIS and advanced applications driven by the student's research. Some prior programming experience is expected along with exposure to geospatial modeling, such as in GIS/MEA 582 or equivalent.

You will also discover that cryptography has a much broader range of applications. It solves absolutely paradoxical problems such as proving knowledge of a secret without ever revealing the secret (zero-knowledge proof), or computing the output of a function without ever knowing the input of the function (secure computation). Finally, we will look closely at one of the recent popular application of cryptography: the blockchain technology. Additionally, graduate students will study some of the topics in greater depth.

OR 501/ISE 501  Introduction to Operations Research  (3 credit hours)  
Operations Research (OR) is a discipline that involves the development and application of advanced analytical methods to aid complex decisions. This course will provide students with the skills to be able to apply a variety of analytical methods to a diverse set of applications. Methods considered include linear and mixed-integer programming, nonlinear and combinatorial optimization, network models, and machine learning. Focus will be on how to translate real-world problems into appropriate models and then how to apply computational procedures and data so that the models can be used as aids in making decisions. Applications will include improving the operation of a variety of different production and service systems, including healthcare delivery and transportation systems, and also how OR can be used to make better decisions in areas like sports, marketing, and project management. Prerequisites include undergraduate courses in single variable differential and integral calculus and an introductory course in probability.
